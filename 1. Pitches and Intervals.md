# Pitches
> [!DANGER] Definition: Pitch
> A **pitch** is a sound wave with a particular frequency.

> [!DANGER] Definition: Pitch Class
> A **pitch class** is the set of all pitches separated by a whole number of octaves.
> > [!NOTE]
> > The pitches of a given pitch class sound very similar to one another and are thus assigned the same note designations.

# Intervals
> [!DANGER] Definition: Interval
> An **interval** is the distance between any two pitches.

> [!DANGER] Definition: Octave
> An **octave** is the interval between any two pitches whose frequencies relate to one another like 2:1.

> [!DANGER] Definition: Half Step
> A **half step** is an interval comprising $\frac{1}{12}$ of an octave.
> > [!NOTE] Note: 12TET
> > A half step is the smallest interval subdivision of the octave in the contemporary 12-Tone Equal Temperament (12TET) tuning system.

> [!DANGER] Definition: Whole Step
> A **whole step** is an interval comprising two half steps or $\frac{1}{6}$ of an octave.

### Types of Intervals
> [!DANGER] Definition: Melodic Interval
> An interval is called **melodic** when it pertains to two pitches sounding consecutively.
> > [!DANGER] Definition: Ascending Interval
> > A melodic interval is called **ascending** when the second pitch is higher than the first.
> 
> > [!DANGER] Definition: Descending Interval
> > A melodic interval is called **descending** when the second pitch is lower than the first.

> [!DANGER] Definition: Harmonic Interval
> An interval is called **harmonic** when it pertains to two pitches sounding at the same time.

### Interval Naming
Depending on the context, the same interval may have a different name.
